  Your task is to build out this netflix navbar clone project and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

  This project focuses mostly your knowledge with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

  You can use any tools you like to help you complete this project. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

  Your users should be able to:
